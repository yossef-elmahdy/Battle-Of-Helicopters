# Battle of Helicopters
The final project of the "Computer Graphics" course which was taught by Eng.Hossam Balaha in 20/21 semester, Computer Engineering major, using `Java`, particularly `Java Applet` and its most popular graphics and events libraries.

Note: To be able to use the code, you MUST use one of Java IDEs that can compile and render Java Applet code such as [JCreator](http://www.jcreator.org/download.htm), [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

## Lessons Learned
- Unit testing
- Building the code in an ordered way (some sort of SW Development)
- Using comments and documentation in code to be self explanatory
- Some fundamentals of how the graphics and shapes are rendered on computer
- Some fundamentals of how the computer flatten the 3D (or what we think it is) to a 2D plotting
- Some popular libraries of 2D graphics plotting (awt, graphics 2d)
- Using events and triggers to make full control of the project
